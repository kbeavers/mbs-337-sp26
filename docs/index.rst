MBS 337: Research Computing in Biology
======================================

The objective of this course is to give students practical experience with
essential computing skills used in modern biological research settings. The
course teaches core principles of research software engineering,
reproducibility, automation, scientific data management, development and
operations (DevOps), cloud computing, and high-performance computing to address
real-world applications in bioimaging, genomics, protein folding, and drug
discovery. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to design,
implement, and share robust computational pipelines for a variety of biological
research problems.
