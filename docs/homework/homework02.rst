Homework 01
===========

**Due Date: Tuesday, January 27 by 11:00am CST**

As Good as Git Gets
-------------------

Your task for the second homework is to create a new Git repository and populate
it with several files / folders. This Git repository must be pushed to GitHub,
and it will be used for the rest of the semester to turn in your homeworks.

Here are the requirements for the Git repository:

* Must contain a top level ``README.md`` with a simple description of what the
  repository contains
* Must contain a directory called ``homework01``
* Must contain five different Python scripts, each solving one
  Exercise at the end of the
  `Python Refresher guide <https://mbs-337-sp26.readthedocs.io/en/latest/unit01/python_refresher.html#exercises>`_
* The directory ``homework01`` must also contain a ``README.md`` file with a
  description of the Python scripts (contents may vary between students)
* **Must contain a minimum of five commits - use git log to see commits**
* Must be pushed to GitHub, and be either public or private (if private, make
  sure to add kbeavers@tacc.utexas.edu, wallen@tacc.utexas.edu, and
  eferlani@tacc.utexas.edu as collaborators on the repo)

A sample Git repository may contain the following files after completing
homework 01:

.. code-block:: text

   my-mbs337-repo/
   ├── homework01
   │   ├── exercise1.py 
   │   ├── exercise2.py
   │   ├── exercise3.py
   │   ├── exercise4.py
   │   ├── exercise5.py
   │   └── README.md          # specifically describes the contents of the homework01 directory
   └── README.md              # generally describes the whole repo

What to Turn In
---------------

Send an email to kbeavers@tacc.utexas.edu, wallen@tacc.utexas.edu, and
eferlani@tacc.utexas.edu with the link to your GitHub repository and include 
"Homework 01" in the subject line. We will clone all of your repos at the due date / time for evaluation.
