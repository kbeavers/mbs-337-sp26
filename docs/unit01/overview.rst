Unit 1: Onboarding and Essential Skills
=======================================

We will use the first few days of class to set expectations and define
requirements for the upcoming semester. We will begin to set up some necessary
accounts and onboard students into the TACC / class ecosystem. We will also
review essential Linux, Python, and Version Control (Git) skills that will be
necessary for the rest of this course.
