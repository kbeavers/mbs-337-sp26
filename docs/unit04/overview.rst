Unit 4: Best Practices in Python
=======================================

In this unit, we will work on improving our Python3 code-writing habits to make 
our code easier to read, easier to debug, and easier to test. A little extra 
effort towards writing good code will pay off down the line when we start 
developing and testing new features or re-using old code blocks in new applications. 
Specifically, we will learn and practice topics in code organization, documentation, 
logging, unit testing, and exception handling.
